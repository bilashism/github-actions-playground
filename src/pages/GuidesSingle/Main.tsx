              Refunds to Your Original Method of Payment Policy

                We can only refund money to the bank or PayPal account from

                Full and partial refunds are available; however, the
                availability of partial refunds depends on the policies of
                specific payment systems. While most payment systems support
                full refunds, only a limited number of larger payment systems,
                such as PayPal, allow partial refunds. Unfortunately, FullBoosts
                does not have control over this aspect.
              </li>
              <li>
                Regarding inquiries about the status of refunds to the original
                method of payment, we kindly ask that you allow 96 business
                hours to pass before contacting us. After the refund is
                processed to your original method of payment, the transfer of
                funds to your personal bank account may take between 1 and 14
                business days (in the case of card payments). The exact duration
                depends on the specific payment system, and FullBoosts does not
                have control over this process.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you have replenished your FullBoosts balance and subsequently
                utilized a portion of it or if the Arbitration Team has
                partially refunded your payment due to a dispute with a seller,
                only a partial refund option will be available. If your payment
                system does not support partial refunds, a refund to your
                personal account will not be possible. Nevertheless, the balance
                will remain on your FullBoosts account, and you can use it for
                future transactions on the website.
              </li>
              <li>
                No additional commission fees are applied to refunds made to the
                original method of payment. You will receive the exact amount
                you originally paid, including any commission fees charged by
                the payment system at the time of the transaction (such as bank
                or PayPal fees), as they will also be refunded to you.
