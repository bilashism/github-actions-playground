/**
 * The `GradientBordered` component is a React component that wraps its children with a div and applies
 * a gradient-bordered style to it.
 * @param {GradientBorderedProps}  - 1. `ReactNode`: This is a type from the React library that
 * represents any valid React node, such as JSX elements, strings, or numbers. It is used to define the
 * type of the `children` prop, which can accept any valid React node.
 * @returns The `GradientBordered` component is returning a `div` element with the provided `className`
 * and `children` as its content. The `className` is being passed to the `cn` function from the `utils`
 * module to generate a combined class name. The `cn` function is likely used to concatenate multiple
 * class names together.
